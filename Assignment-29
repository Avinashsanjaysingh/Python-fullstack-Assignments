1. Write a Python script to print the following status of a file:
a. Whether a file is read only
b. Whether a file is closed or not
c. Which file opening mode is used
d. Name of the file

def print_file_status(file):
    if file.closed:
        print("File is closed.")
    else:
        print("File is open.")
    
    if file.readable():
        print("File is readable.")
    else:
        print("File is not readable.")
    
    if file.writable():
        print("File is writable.")
    else:
        print("File is not writable.")
    
    print("File mode:", file.mode)
    print("File name:", file.name)

# Usage
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    print_file_status(file)

2. Write a Python script to create a new file ‘myfile.txt’ and store user entered text.
user_input = input("Enter text to store in myfile.txt: ")
with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(user_input)

3. Write a Python script to read the above created file ‘myfile.txt’ and display content on the console.
with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

4. Write a Python script to store a list of city names in a file ‘cities.txt’
cities = ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']

with open('cities.txt', 'w') as file:
    for city in cities:
        file.write(city + '\n')

5. Write a Python script to append list of city names in a file ‘cities.txt’
new_cities = ['San Francisco', 'Miami']

with open('cities.txt', 'a') as file:
    for city in new_cities:
        file.write(city + '\n')

6. Write a Python script to search whether a particular city is there in the file ‘cities.txt’ or not
search_city = 'Chicago'

with open('cities.txt', 'r') as file:
    cities = file.read().splitlines()

if search_city in cities:
    print(f"{search_city} is in the list of cities.")
else:
    print(f"{search_city} is not in the list of cities.")

7. Write a Python script to count the number of Python keywords occurring in a python source file.
import keyword

def count_python_keywords(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        source_code = file.read()
    
    keywords = keyword.kwlist
    keyword_count = 0

    for kw in keywords:
        keyword_count += source_code.count(kw)
    
    return keyword_count

file_name = 'python_source.py'  # Replace with your source file name
count = count_python_keywords(file_name)
print(f"Number of Python keywords in {file_name}: {count}")

8. Write a Python script to create a copy of a file.
import shutil

source_file = 'original.txt'
destination_file = 'copy.txt'

shutil.copy(source_file, destination_file)

9. Write a Python script to store book data in a file. Book data is in the form of a
dictionary in which book name is the key and price is its value. Use pickle to store
data into a file (say bookfile)

import pickle

book_data = {
    'Book1': 20.99,
    'Book2': 15.50,
    'Book3': 30.25
}

with open('bookfile.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(book_data, file)

10. Write a Python script to extract book data from a bookfile using pickle. Also print extracted book data.
import pickle

with open('bookfile.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    extracted_data = pickle.load(file)

print("Extracted book data:")
for book, price in extracted_data.items():
    print(f"{book}: ${price}")
